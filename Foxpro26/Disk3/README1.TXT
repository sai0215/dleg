This directory, FPW26\GOODIES, contains four files:

   allunpak.bat  - program to unpack the sample files
   readme.txt    - (this file) an explanation of this directory
   goodies.pak   - compressed sample files and bitmaps
   foxunpak.exe  - a program to unpack the sample files


To unpack the samples, from the File Manager select 'allunpak.bat' 
and double click on it.  Or, from the the MS-DOS command prompt type

   allunpak

The unpack process will create the following directories:

    bitmaps    - bitmaps and icons you can use in your applications
    dos        - files that make the menus more like FoxPro for MS-DOS
    fndation   - foundation read examples
    foxdata    - a general purpose FoxPro DDE server
    foxtools   - sample programs that use FOXTOOLS.FLL
    misc       - miscellaneous individual programs
    pdrivers   - printer driver source code

In some circumstances the FoxPro Goodies unpacking program, 
ALLUNPAK.BAT, causes a memory error.  If this occurs, you can unpack 
the Goodies files by running ALLUNPACK from the main MS-DOS prompt 
(not a MS-DOS window).
